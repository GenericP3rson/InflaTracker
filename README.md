### Inspiration
One of our teammate is suffering from Crohn's Disease. For a Crohn's Disease patient, it is often difficult to identify which ingredients in their foods causes inflammation of their stomach.

### What it Does
Our app allows users to track foods, writing whether they cause or did not cause inflammation. Using Machine Learning, our algorithm looks at the ingredients of all the foods the user has eaten and identifies which ingredients cause the inflammation and which do not.
