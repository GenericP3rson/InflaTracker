GenericPersonToday at 9:16 PM
Nice, nice. If this isn't too intrusive, which season of Star Trek are you watching now?
html1011Today at 9:17 PM
I don't know, we're rewatching DS9 now.
We finished the original series, though. I'm sorry but it was really, really bad.
GenericPersonToday at 9:17 PM
That's okay. I guess it's a choice.
html1011Today at 9:18 PM
Yeah. The choice between the stereotypical woman-off-my-bridge-and-constantly-in-my-bed and the normal, equal relationship between the two.
GenericPersonToday at 9:18 PM
I'm probably going to start Picard if I have any free time. Do you think it's good?
It wasn't that sexual?
html1011Today at 9:19 PM
Are you joking me?!?!?!
GenericPersonToday at 9:19 PM
Or maybe I just don't understand the sexual references?
Wait. Has the Star Trek I've loved and cherished actually been really sexual?
What?
Sarah. My entire world is confused now.
html1011Today at 9:20 PM
It's not directly sexual, but come on, the women were prancing around in scandalous clothing as their uniforms the entire time.
And in every single episode Kirk is kissing a women. I counted.
Every. Single. Episode.
GenericPersonToday at 9:20 PM
Really?
What?
html1011Today at 9:20 PM
You'll be hard pressed to find one he didn't.
Okay, maybe not kissed, but at least fell in love with and attempted to flirt with.
GenericPersonToday at 9:21 PM
I don't know what flirting sounds like!
Or falling in love looks like?
html1011Today at 9:21 PM
When the little flute music comes out and he gets very close to the women.
GenericPersonToday at 9:21 PM
I thought I knew what kissing looks like though?
html1011Today at 9:22 PM
Then he starts looking at her breasts and you can literally see the look on his face.
Now that is what I call extremely stereotypical and anti-feminist.
GenericPersonToday at 9:22 PM
What? Uh... Sarah? That's so weird.
That's wrong.
html1011Today at 9:23 PM
You can look it up if you want.
GenericPersonToday at 9:23 PM
But Kirk is a cool guy?
html1011Today at 9:23 PM
The actor even is anti-feminist.
Kirk is not a cool guy.
GenericPersonToday at 9:23 PM
Really? Wow.
html1011Today at 9:23 PM
Kirk is the worst character on there.
GenericPersonToday at 9:23 PM
And thus ends my love for Star Trek...
That's terrible.
Bad Kirk.
html1011Today at 9:24 PM
He was super power-hungry. Like, there were times when he would literally force them(the crew) to change the script if he wasn't the main character.
GenericPersonToday at 9:24 PM
I didn't know that.
That's terrible.
html1011Today at 9:25 PM
But how did you even like it in the first place?
GenericPersonToday at 9:25 PM
I thought they brought up really interesting problems and scenarios.
Something that wasn't completely improbable but also projected into the future such that it wasn't yet attainable.
html1011Today at 9:25 PM
Like what? They barely ever mentioned anything remotely cool in the original!
GenericPersonToday at 9:27 PM
The computer warfare was really interesting to me where the computer ultimately took over and forced the warfare. The silicon-based creature was something cool to think about. Those are just two off the top of my head.
I guess... I liked it for their concepts?
But Shreya won't like them anymore based on their morals.
html1011Today at 9:27 PM
If you want interesting concepts, try the new ones.
GenericPersonToday at 9:28 PM
Which would you suggest?
DS9?
The Next Generation's season 1 was weird...
html1011Today at 9:28 PM
DS9 is pretty cool. I thought before it was super political but it's not really.
The Next Generation is really, really bad! Don't watch it!
GenericPersonToday at 9:29 PM
Gotcha, Captain.
html1011Today at 9:29 PM
No, that's bad. The acting is terrible.
Though now that you've got past the first season, if you persist, it gets increasingly better.
GenericPersonToday at 9:29 PM
But about Wesley? I thought you really liked him?
Though now that you've got past the first season, if you persist, it gets increasingly better.
@html1011 I didn't. I watched a few episodes.
html1011Today at 9:30 PM
To be honest, we skipped the first season and went back to it later.
GenericPersonToday at 9:30 PM
You know, I did like the one I watched in the plane.
html1011Today at 9:30 PM
The confusion easily goes away after a while.
DS9 is pretty good. We actually really are liking it the second time around.
Enterprise is really bad, but, if you like the old-timey episodes and a captain like Kirk that isn't so anti-feminist, maybe you should go for that one.
GenericPersonToday at 9:32 PM
I'll take your word for it. DS9 it is.
But, Sarah, I have no clue how you manage to make time for movies.
html1011Today at 9:33 PM
Voyager is the best by far though.
Like, the best. DS9 has grown on me. Voyager I loved from the beginning.
GenericPersonToday at 9:33 PM
I remember you first watching that.
html1011Today at 9:33 PM
And if you like theoretical concepts, it's the one for you.
The captain(who's a woman) strands them out in the Delta Quadrant and they have to find a way to get home(which could take 70 years if they went as fast as possible) because she stuck to her morals.
GenericPersonToday at 9:35 PM
Have you gotten a chance to rewatch it?
html1011Today at 9:35 PM
I've already rewatched it.
&#9786;
GenericPersonToday at 9:36 PM
Aw. So the chance of me asking you to Kosmi it with me is probably no?
html1011Today at 9:37 PM
Sorry, I don't think my family will want to watch it again.
I mean, I think they will, just not so close to when we already watched it.
And we still need to finish DS9.
GenericPersonToday at 9:38 PM
Well, like just you and me? But, like, I understand.
My family doesn't like Star Trek, so I doubt they would want to watch it with me. Maybe someone in robotics would like it?
html1011Today at 9:39 PM
Well... they don't like the original. Maybe you should convince them to try Voyager.
GenericPersonToday at 9:39 PM
They don't like American movies period.
html1011Today at 9:39 PM
We didn't like the original. We had to push through it and there were a couple of episodes we had to skip they were so bad.
I fell asleep while watching one of them(Plato's Stepchildren, the one where Kirk kind of kisses Uhura).
GenericPersonToday at 9:40 PM
I don't think I got to that one?
To old Shreya, Kirk would never violate Uhura like that...
Why does everything have to do with sex?
That's annoying.
html1011Today at 9:41 PM
It's the famous one because it was one of the first interracial kisses on television.
Though he was forced to by some aliens, so I don't blame him there.
If anything, I think the message was the opposite of what they wanted. It was so bad because it was like it took crazy telepathic aliens to get him to kiss an African American when he wouldn't hesitate normally to kiss a white woman.
GenericPersonToday at 9:43 PM
That is fair.
Well... I guess I'll just see if another from robotics would like to watch it with me? Then I'll probably stream it.
I'll let you know what our reactions are.
html1011Today at 9:43 PM
Though I'd go with what you were saying before with Picard. Picard is amazing.
I only watched the first episode(they had it free on Youtube for like 3 days), but it was really, really good.
My dad didn't like it, but I don't really know why.
It was incredible. And the graphics were amazing.
GenericPersonToday at 9:45 PM
We have the entire season on our box.
html1011Today at 9:45 PM
But the one I can vouch for the most is Discovery if you have CBS All Access.
GenericPersonToday at 9:45 PM
Oh. That one I've started.
html1011Today at 9:45 PM
That one is my favorite by far.
What do you think?????
The graphics are incredible compared to the old one, no?
GenericPersonToday at 9:46 PM
It was good, but I was really tired for the first, like, five episodes.
Oh. And it was uncomfortably sexual, but I shouldn't be the one talking.
But, yeah, the graphics were nice.
html1011Today at 9:46 PM
How was it sexual???
GenericPersonToday at 9:46 PM
The man and the woman?
html1011Today at 9:47 PM
That is really, really general.
GenericPersonToday at 9:47 PM
No, when they're both in bed?
html1011Today at 9:47 PM
Which man and woman??? When are they both in bed???
Michael Burnham?
GenericPersonToday at 9:48 PM
This woman. Maybe that man?

html1011Today at 9:48 PM
Oh, so you're pretty late in.
GenericPersonToday at 9:48 PM
I was?
html1011Today at 9:48 PM
Yeah, that's Michael Burnham and Ash Tyler.
GenericPersonToday at 9:49 PM
The girl left the man though.
html1011Today at 9:49 PM
So where are you in it?
GenericPersonToday at 9:49 PM
This was, like, a few years ago.
(Last year?)
They saw the enterprise at the end, I think?
html1011Today at 9:49 PM
Wow. Then I'd rewatch it. It's really worth rewatching.
Oh, okay. So Captain Pike is going to come in.
GenericPersonToday at 9:50 PM
But the one I can vouch for the most is Discovery if you have CBS All Access.
@html1011 I don't have CBS All Access though.
html1011Today at 9:50 PM
How are you getting the episodes then?
There's no way of getting Picard without CBS All Access?
GenericPersonToday at 9:51 PM
It's with my Dubba.
html1011Today at 9:51 PM
Dubba?
GenericPersonToday at 9:51 PM
It translates to Box.
My Box has a bunch of series and movies, etc.
html1011Today at 9:52 PM
Then it has to have CBS All Access on it.
GenericPersonToday at 9:52 PM
Does it? I don't think so...
It mostly has a bunch of Hindi-dubbed movies on there.
Well, I can't tell you the official name, so I suppose you're correct.
Do you have CBS All Access?
html1011Today at 9:54 PM
No. My dad doesn't want to get it. The only way we watched Discovery was to download it when we were in other countries because that's the only way it's available on Netflix.
GenericPersonToday at 9:54 PM
Wow.
Well, if you want to watch Picard or rewatch Discovery, I could stream them for you sometime?
html1011Today at 9:55 PM
We'll see. Unfortunately what I watch I watch with my family and my dad doesn't like it, so.... I'm not sure how it'll work.
But I thought it was really cool.
GenericPersonToday at 9:55 PM
Makes sense.
html1011Today at 9:56 PM
Also, if you're going to watch Picard, I'd recommend finishing The Next Generation. It's really worth it because you understand why all the characters are so important.
GenericPersonToday at 9:56 PM
Understood, Captain.
html1011Today at 9:56 PM
There's also a super, super good character in there that's from Voyager....
GenericPersonToday at 9:57 PM
So watch Voyager and Next Generation before watching Picard?
And throw KS9 while I'm at it?
html1011Today at 9:57 PM
Yeah. Voyager isn't necessary, but to be honest it's better to watch the old ones before you get used to how well done the new ones are.
GenericPersonToday at 9:57 PM
Affirmative.
html1011Today at 9:58 PM
Can I spoil? A little?
GenericPersonToday at 9:58 PM
Sure. Feel free. I'm here to listen, and it's really nice to see you so happy and fired up.
html1011Today at 10:00 PM
Well, in Voyager, there's this character called Seven of Nine who is a Borg(an evil species that creates a collective mind and tries to take over the galaxy and is super cool), and she is taken in by Voyager. She was assimilated when she was a little girl so she doesn't know how to be human, so you basically get to watch her evolve. The actor is super good, and she is in Picard.
Though she acts really different in Picard, and I don't know why yet, so it's kind of important to see how she was back then to understand her there.
GenericPersonToday at 10:01 PM
Oh yeah! You have a Skype description about the Borg once!
html1011Today at 10:01 PM
Yup, that's their motto: We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
See, now they're theoretically very interesting to think about.
GenericPersonToday at 10:02 PM
Though she acts really different in Picard, and I don't know why yet, so it's kind of important to see how she was back then to understand her there.
@html1011 Wow. Do you think that it's because you've missed some episodes or there's something you're yet to learn?
You know what they reminded me of? Doctor Who.
html1011Today at 10:02 PM
I think it's something we need to figure out.
GenericPersonToday at 10:03 PM
(If Anabelle gets over her fear of Doctor Who, it might be something you'd be interested in later. Though I'm clearly not one to give recommendations.)
html1011Today at 10:03 PM
Yeah, maybe we should get into it.
GenericPersonToday at 10:03 PM
I've actually started with the more modern ones.
html1011Today at 10:03 PM
Though the first episode definitely freaked her out with all the melting mannequins....
GenericPersonToday at 10:04 PM
Most of them are a little scary, but they're definitely not horror.
html1011Today at 10:04 PM
I don't remember much from it. All I remember is mannequins trying to take over the world? And wax. Lots of melting wax.
GenericPersonToday at 10:04 PM
It's classy science fiction, taking a problem to the extreme.
html1011Today at 10:04 PM
And some kind of alien.
And Doctor Who, of course.
GenericPersonToday at 10:04 PM
The best doctor is the 10th.
You're at the 9th.
The doctor never dies. Obviously, that takes a huge toll on a person.
You can really see that sort of burden on the 10th doctor. You can sort of see how he sometimes wishes he could be normal and just die, but he pushes on to save the people around him. You can see the amount of pain he has because he hurt people in his past, but he's strong enough to push forth from that pain.
His acting skills are incredible. He's also a really lovable character, and he's really quirky.
html1011Today at 10:07 PM
I'm not sure Anabelle is going to like that. Anabelle's kind of in that stage where she doesn't like things that talk about dying.
GenericPersonToday at 10:07 PM
Oh. Uh... there's not much actual dying.
Do you think Star Trek had a lot of dying?
html1011Today at 10:08 PM
No, not really.
GenericPersonToday at 10:08 PM
Then Doctor Who didn't either.
html1011Today at 10:08 PM
The original did though! Don't even get me started on that....
GenericPersonToday at 10:08 PM
(Okay, not getting you started...)
html1011Today at 10:08 PM
Literally like half of his crew dies and he doesn't care!
Just as long as it's not the main characters, it doesn't matter.
GenericPersonToday at 10:09 PM
I don't think he didn't care? Of course, I didn't really understand it...
html1011Today at 10:09 PM
And that's also incredibly unrealistic. He loses a ton of his crew and suddenly in the next episode he's up and running with a full crew.
I mean, it never explicitly confronted the problem...
Also, the doctor is literally useless. He just freaks out and starts yelling on the bridge.
He just basically says everything that's clearly obvious whenever he's supposed to tell them something intellectual!
GenericPersonToday at 10:12 PM
Poor McCoy...
Discovery: You really hated the Originals.
There was nothing you liked about it.
html1011Today at 10:13 PM
Yeah. It was really, really difficult to go through.
Though it was interesting to see how it all started.
GenericPersonToday at 10:13 PM
It was hard for me as well, but it got more interesting once I got into it.
I guess "once I got into it" meant my ignoring everything besides the concepts.
html1011Today at 10:14 PM
They kind of always start off badly, but you get more attached to the characters. Then it's down to how interesting it gets from there.
Though what makes me interested about Picard is that it started really well, which never happens.
GenericPersonToday at 10:15 PM
Wow. So it's the first Star Trek series with actual hope!
If I find time to watch it, should I rant about each episode to you?
Or must I actually wait till you watch it?
html1011Today at 10:17 PM
Whatever you want.
GenericPersonToday at 10:18 PM
Well, if you're every going to watch it, I wouldn't want to spoil it for you?
But that's up in the air because of your dad?
html1011Today at 10:19 PM
It's fine, you can watch it without spoiling it for me?
GenericPersonToday at 10:20 PM
For sure.
Is there anything else Star-Trek-related that you'd like to talk about?
html1011Today at 10:21 PM
I think I'm all Star-Trekked out.
Bye, I guess? For now?
GenericPersonToday at 10:22 PM
Goodbye, Sarah. Thank you for your advice.
