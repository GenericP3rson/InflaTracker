        <p>
            Hi there!
            <br>
            We are Sarah Cross and Shreya Chaudhary, two highschoolers
            looking to make a difference in the world.

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
            The story goes back to about two years ago, when one of our siblings was diagnosed
            with Crohn's disease. What made the situation incredibly difficult was the level of
            uncertainity. What foods would trigger a gastrointestinal reaction? Which ones wouldn't?
            There are a lot of suggested diets out there which follow what generally causes these problems;
            however, a lot of this comes down to <i>you</i>. There is no one answer, no one cure. Everyone 
            is different and the bacteria in our colon is different. So we created InflaTracker to help.
        </p>
        <h1>Quick Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>
            We created this application to help with inflammation. It uses a machine learning algorithm 
            to classify foods that tend to hurt your stomach versus ones that don't. However, there is a 
            level of experimentation in this. This is meant for people who are willing to put themselves 
            out there, try new things, and help the algorithm learn. We highly recommend to consult your 
            doctor first before using our application.
